# Introduction to Amazon S3
## Project Overview

Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) is one of the most fundamental and widely-used services in the AWS cloud computing platform. As an object storage service, S3 offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance for a wide variety of use cases, including data lakes, websites, mobile applications, backup and restore, archive, enterprise applications, IoT devices, and big data analytics.

## Project Objectives

This hands-on project is designed to provide participants with a comprehensive introduction to Amazon S3 and its core functionalities. Through practical exercises, participants will gain firsthand experience working with this essential cloud storage service. The project focuses on building foundational knowledge that is critical for anyone pursuing cloud computing or working with AWS infrastructure.

## Learning Scope

The project curriculum covers the essential aspects of S3 management, beginning with bucket creation and configuration through the AWS Management Console. Participants will learn how to:
- Create and properly configure S3 buckets, understanding the significance of region selection and naming conventions
- Upload, organize, and manage objects within these buckets
- Implement version control to maintain object history and prevent accidental data loss
- Configure granular permissions to ensure proper access control and security
- Design and apply lifecycle policies to automate data management processes

## Practical Applications

By mastering these S3 fundamentals, participants will develop skills directly applicable to real-world scenarios such as:
- Building secure cloud storage solutions for applications and websites
- Implementing data backup and recovery strategies
- Optimizing storage costs through intelligent tiering and lifecycle management
- Configuring proper access controls for sensitive data
- Maintaining data integrity through version control systems

This project serves as an essential stepping stone for anyone beginning their AWS journey, providing the practical S3 knowledge that forms the foundation for more advanced cloud architectures and solutions. The hands-on approach ensures participants not only understand theoretical concepts but can immediately apply them in professional environments.

# Part D

1. ### Lets add permissions for the bucket
Navigate to permission section of the bucket and "Block all Public Access" by unchecking the box, then click on Edit, SAVE the changes.

![Upload an Object](./img/21.%20apply%20permission.jpg)
![Upload an Object](./img/22.%20Editing%20permission.jpg)
- Confirm the permission
![Upload an Object](./img/23.%20Confirm%20and%20submit.jpg)
![Upload an Object](./img/24.%20Success.jpg)

**Note:** Once this is confirm, you have allow your file to be publicly accessble to anyone that have the public url and you are aware and responsible for any implication.

2. Lets add policy to the bucket to specify action you want your client to perform
![Upload an Object](./img/25.%20Editing%20bucket%20policy.jpg)

    }
  ]
}
```
**Navigate back to the AWS Console**

Security Best Practices
- Least Privilege
- HTTPS Enforcement
- Roles Instead of Users
- Bucket Versioning
- Default Encryption
- Public Access Block


## Project Reflection
Key Learnings
Policy Granularity Matters: Separating bucket-level and object-level permissions prevents overprivileged access

Versioning is Critical: Protects against accidental deletions and ransomware

Encryption Hierarchy: SSE-KMS with bucket keys reduces costs while maintaining security

Temporary Credentials: Roles provide more secure access than long-term keys

### Maintenance Guide
Policy Versioning: Always create new policy versions instead of editing live policies

Quarterly Reviews: Audit permissions using IAM Access Analyzer

Credential Rotation: Use roles instead of long-term credentials
